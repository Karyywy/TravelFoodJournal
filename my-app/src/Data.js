        description: "In the Setagaya district of Tokyo, there is a real hidden gem of a temple. Gotokuji temple is well known across Japan as the supposed origin of Maneki-neko, the “beckoning cat” figurine which is said to bring good fortune and success to its owner if kept in their bedroom or place of study. The temple is surrounded bythousands of Maneki-neko figures (beckoning cat figures). Today visitors can purchase Maneki-neko figures of various sizes in the temple shop, and even the ema plates have cat motives. (Ema plates are small wooden plaques on which one writes a prayer or wish). As a warm reminder, you can only purchase each size of Maneki-neko figure once. Please take one and bring luck to your home.",

The custard is thick and thick, and there are no vanilla beans in it. Can't wait to revisit and grab the cream puff!",

        description:"This small and private temple is south of Daikaku-ji, opposite Seiryo-ji and, not too far from the very famous Bamboo Groves. The temple's name derives from the ingo (posthumous Buddhist name) of Yoshiakira Ashikaga, the second shogun of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).Especially in autumn, the temple’s garden is filled with beautiful red leaves.  The garden itself isn’t huge due to being a very small temple, but it is filled with trees and plants making you unaware to whether the garden actually ends or not! This is a great idea to stop people standing in the way and making other's visit not so nice and relaxing.",
